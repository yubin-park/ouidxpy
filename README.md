# ouidxpy

Overuse Index Python version

This project is based on [Overuse-Index-Segal-et-al-Johns-Hopkins-University-ICD-10-Coding](https://github.com/susanmhutfless/Overuse-Index-Segal-et-al-Johns-Hopkins-University-ICD-10-Coding).

I made it usable as a Python library with some assumptions.

Please contact me if you want to properly use the package.

## Install

`pyproject.toml` is still in BETA

Use `setup.cfg`

`>>> from ouidxpy.ouidx import Ouidx`
