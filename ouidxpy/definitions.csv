11,Meniscectomy in patients with DJD of the knee,Motivator: partial meniscectomy or meniscus repair or placement of an artificial meniscus have little value in patients with DJD of the knee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,Indicator: use of meniscectomy in a population of patients with DJD       ,Procedure code with inclusionary diagnosis code in preceding 60 days and with NO exclusionary code on associated with the procedure (same claim).,Inpatient or outpatient (including ED)
12,Nasal endoscopy for sinusitis diagnosis,"Motivator:  patients with acute sinusitis should not be rushed to nasal endoscopy; this would only be indicated for chronic sinusitis



",Indicator: Nasal endoscopy in patients with acute sinusitis without a history of chronic sinusitis,Inclusionary diagnosis code is associated with the procedure code (same claim)  AND  no exclusionary diagnosis code in preceding 180 days,Outpatient only; No inpatient and no ED
13,Use of routine cervical cytology (Pap tests) in women over 65 years,Motivator: there is no reduction in morbidity and mortality with cervical cancer screening in women at low risk of cervical cancer ,Indicator:  PAP smears seen in consecutive years among women over 65 years AND diagnosis of screening ,Procedure code with inclusionary diagnosis code (same claim) and person is 65 years or older,Outpatient only; No inpatient and no ED
14,Screening mammography in women 85 years and older,Motivator: women over age 85 have slowly growing cancers and do not benefit form screening given short life expectancy                                                                                                                                                    ,Indicator: mammography in women 85 years and older AND a diagnosis of screening for breast cancer    ,Procedure code with inclusionary diagnosis code (same claim) and person is 85 years or older,Outpatient only; No inpatient and no ED
